## What is Ballz?
<br/> Ballz is Breakout style game that goes on forever unil the row of boxes touches the ground where ball is located. Additionally, the player can collect more balls and with a click on the screen, all the balls will collide with the rows of boxes and delete them. A row of boxes gets added for each additional level. <br/> Below is an example of a playing screen of Ballz.
